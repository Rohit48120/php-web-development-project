This project is a clone of our college website created as a part of PHP web developement mini project. We tried to clone our college website. We have created the navigation bar, ABOUT US button pop up, slideshow animation, news, spotlight and college achievements, our college alumni and their details, college location embedded using map in out HTML page. Also we have an Apply for Admission button and Feedback form from where the students can submit their Admission details and feedback about the college respectively. Using php, we submited that entered details in the PhpmyAdmin database. Obviously we were not able to create dynmaic, content-rich, feature-rich and interactive website like our college, but as a part of our mini project we still tried to include some of the basic features and interactions, while focusing on PHP was our main part in this project.
